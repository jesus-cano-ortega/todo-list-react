The objective of this project is to display a To-Do List using React. The main objective of this project is to put in practice the React skills
learned and the use of Hooks (useState) and logic inside components. 

React improves the creation of custom components, which you can render throughout your web-app using the ReactDOM.render() method. A custom component allows you to divide and conquer, separating logical and visual challenges into smaller pieces- giving you greater control over the display and functionalities of each part of the web-app you are developing.

### Instructions

1. The tasks are added when the user press enter on the keyboard or you can have your own button.
2. The delete icon shows only when the task is hovered.
3. The use can add as many tasks as it wants.
4. When there is no tasks the list should "No tasks, add a task"
5. There is no way to update a task, the user will ahve to delete and create again.

##### REMEMBER: 

Once the progress and flow of the project is finished, you must commit and push the repository remotely, using the following command:

```
$ git add . 
$ git commit -m "Message"
$ git push origin repo-remote
```

This template is similar to create-react-app but it's meant for 4Geeks Academy students.

##### and install the npm package:
```
$ npm install
```
## Start coding!

For Windows, Mac, Linux or Gitpod, start the webpack server with live reload:

You can update the `styles/index.scss` or `js/index.js` depending on your needs.
Add more files into your, `./src/js/components` or styles folder as you need them.
